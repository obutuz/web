## Getting Started

First of all, make sure that you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your machine.

* [How to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* [How to install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Afterwards, fork this project, then clone your repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/ui.git
```

Get the dependencies needed for this project:

```
yarn install
```

Finally, start create-react-app's local server so you can run your app in development:

```
yarn start
```

This project requires our API backend to run properly, so you'll have to setup [Open Budget Core](https://github.com/obudget/core) on your machine as well.

Instructions for installing the API backend are posted here: https://github.com/obudget/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started

The app is located (by default) at http://localhost:3000
